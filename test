 Step 2: Extract Text
- Lambda function retrieves document from S3
- Amazon Textract extracts all text content
- Extracted text is displayed to user for review

 Step 3: Generate Quiz
- User selects preferences:
  - Number of questions (1-20)
  - Difficulty level (easy/medium/hard)
  - Question type (multiple choice)
- Text is sent to second Lambda function
- Claude AI generates customized quiz questions with:
  - Question text
  - 4 multiple choice options
  - Correct answer

- Other services: ~$5/month
- Total: ~$50-75/month

🛠️ AWS Services Used

| Service | Purpose | Why This Service |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| S3 | Document storage | Cheap, reliable, easy Lambda integration |
| Lambda | Serverless compute | No server management, pay per use |
| API Gateway | REST API endpoints | Managed API with built-in security |
| Bedrock | AI text generation | Access to Claude without managing infrastructure |
| Textract | OCR/text extraction | Purpose-built for document processing |
| CloudWatch | Logging & monitoring | Native AWS monitoring solution |

🎨 Design Decisions

 Why Serverless?
- No server maintenance
- Auto-scaling
- Pay only for what you use
- Perfect for sporadic usage patterns

 Why Claude (Bedrock)?
- Excellent at following instructions
- Consistent JSON output
- Strong reasoning for educational content
- No need to manage API keys separately

 Why React Frontend?
- Component-based architecture
- Easy state management
- Fast development
- Great user experience

📊 Technical Highlights

 Lambda Function 1: Text Extraction
- Trigger: API Gateway POST request
- Process: Fetch document → Textract → Extract lines
- Output: Clean text ready for processing
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Memory: 512 MB

 Lambda Function 2: Quiz Generation
- Trigger: API Gateway POST request
- Process: Format prompt → Call Bedrock → Parse JSON
- Output: Structured quiz questions array
- Timeout: 60 seconds
- Memory: 1024 MB

 API Gateway Configuration
- Type: REST API
- Authentication: None (can add API keys)
- CORS: Enabled for browser access
- Rate Limiting: Optional (10 req/sec recommended)
- Stage: Production

🚀 Deployment Workflow

 Setup Phase:
1. Enable Bedrock model access
2. Create S3 bucket
3. Create IAM roles with proper permissions
4. Deploy Lambda functions
